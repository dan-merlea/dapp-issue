# Elrond SDK for JavaScript: Wallet Connect provider

Signing provider for dApps: Wallet Connect.

Documentation is available on [docs.elrond.com](https://docs.elrond.com/sdk-and-tools/erdjs/erdjs-signing-providers/), while an integration example can be found [here](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-sdk-erdjs-examples/tree/main/signing-providers).

Note that **we recommend using [dapp-core](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/dapp-core)** instead of integrating the signing provider on your own.
